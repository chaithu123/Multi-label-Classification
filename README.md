# Multi-label-Classification

Hi Dr.Janeja,

I had developed Collaborative mining multi labeling algorithm in spark.
I had tested with two publicly available dataset

i)Emotions
    No.of target variables=6
    Aggregate accuracy score=81.3%

ii)Medical
    No of target variables=45
    Aggregate accuracy score=98.134%

The protocol and code of the algorithm ,I'm sending in the attachment.Please suggest me if I can add anythings top of that.In future I am going to test with all the publicly available multi label datasets.
